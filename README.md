__Explanation of files__

_Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_AMGs.accnos_ : All 4,103 IMG/VR, RefSeq and Genbank names or accession numbers of viral AMG protein sequences, respective to _Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_AMGs.faa_.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_AMGs.faa_ : All 4,103 viral AMG protein sequences.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_genomes_full_01.fna_ : First half of the 3,749 viral genomes from IMG/VR, RefSeq and Genbank that encode an AMG. Note: genome files were split into two due to the large file sizes.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_genomes_full_02.fna_ : Second half of the 3,749 viral genomes from IMG/VR, RefSeq and Genbank that encode an AMG. Note: genome files were split into two due to the large file sizes.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_genomes.accnos_ : All 3,749 IMG/VR, RefSeq and Genbank names or accession numbers of viral genome sequences, respective to _Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_genomes_full_01.fna_ and _Kieft_et_al_2019_virus_genomes_full_02.fna_.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_genomes.faa_ : All 167,379 proteins encoded by IMG/VR viruses in which proteins were predicted by this study (excludes viral proteins from RefSeq, Genbank and other studies).

_Kieft_et_al_2021_Supplemental_Data_S1_ : A folder containing a FASTA file for each of the 39 AMGs. Each file is named with the three or four letter protein ID of the AMG followed by the respective KEGG orthology number. The combination of all protein sequences in this folder is identical to _Kieft_et_al_2021_virus_AMGs.faa_.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_Supplemental_Data_S2_ : A folder containing a FASTA file for each of the alignments respective to Figures S1 and S3 to S8 of the full manuscript.

_Kieft_et_al_2021_Supplemental_Data_S3_ : Full genome sequence, in FASTA format, of the _cysC_-encoding Lake Mendota virus.
